### About the application 
CDCâ€™s Vision Health Initiative (VHI) and NORC at the University of Chicago partnered to develop the National Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). VEHSS leverages new and existing data sources to help health professionals, researchers, policy makers, and patients understand the scope of vision loss, eye disorders, and eye care services in the United States. VEHSS is intended to grow and improve over time based on input and needs of the vision health community.  

The goals of the system are to:  
- Identify and collect existing sources of information on vision and eye health.
- Create case definitions to analyze data consistently.
- Analyze data to estimate:
    - The prevalence of eye disorders and disabilities.
    - The use of eye-health services.
    - Health disparities in visual health treatment and outcomes.
- Investigate methods to leverage multiple existing data sources to create new estimates of the prevalence of vision loss and eye disease.
- Disseminate the information developed by the system to key stakeholders, and respond to feedback to continually improve the quality and usefulness of the system.
